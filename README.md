This project is from CMS 270: Object Oriented Design and Development

We were tasked with creating two classes, Msg and FileObject, with specific characteristics and methods. The premise was that the classes were pieces of a broader solution design to a system to be delivered to a fictional client, which was created by the professor. The objectives of the assignment were to demonstrate good Java code, implement interfaces, and interpret system requirements. It is important to note that Driver.java is not part of the solution, but was intented to be used by the authors to test code incrementally and ensure the classes were functioning as intended.
